# rebase-demo

A repo that has had branch commits squashed, rebased and merged to tell a good looking story.

Rebasing and squashing helps 'tell the story' of the repo. It also makes subsequent merges easier by reducing the number of commits you need to look through to work out what anohter committer has inflicted on you!
